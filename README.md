Raspberry Pi Breathalyzer
================

A breathalyzer is created by using a Raspberry Pi microcontroller and an alcohol sensor. By converting the voltage taken in by the alcohol sensor and converting it to a blood alcohol content (BAC), it allows a user to see the content.


### What is a breathalyzer?
A breathalyzer allows a person to view their BAC to determine if they are past the standard BAC or not. This is widely used by police officers in every country.
